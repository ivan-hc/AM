### Create and test your own installation script
Option `-t` or `template` allows you to create an "AM" compatible installation script using a "[templates](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/tree/main/templates)" that can be used by both "AM" and "AppMan". In fact, all AppMan does is take the installation scripts from this database and patch them to make them compatible with a rootless installation.

The syntax to follow is this
```
am -t $PROGRAM
```
or
```
appman -t $PROGRAM
```
The available options are as follows:

0. Create a script for an AppImage package
1. Build an AppImage on the fly using [appimagetool](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit) and [pkg2appimage](https://github.com/AppImage/pkg2appimage)
2. Download and unpack a generic archive (ZIP, TAR...)
3. Create a custom Firefox profile

#### Option Zero: "AppImages"
The easiest script to create is certainly the one relating to AppImages, the "Zero" option.
1. Enter the URL of the site
   - if the AppImage is hosted on github, it will quickly detect the URL
   - if the AppImage is not hosted on github,it will ask you to add a description of the app
2. Detecting the  correct URL
   - if the app is hosted on github, it will ask you if you want to add/remove keywords to use in `grep`, to detect the correct URL, else press ENTER
   - if the app is not hosted on github, add a one-line command to detect the latest version of the app (advanced)
  
In this video I'll create 2 installation scripts:
- the first one is for "gimp", detected as first reference, no extra prompts
- the second one is for "baobab-gtk3", hosted on a repository with multiple packages, so I have to add a keyword ("baobab"), univoque for the URL I'm interested in

#### Option One: "build AppImages on-the-fly"
This was one of the very first approaches used to create this project. Before I started building AppImage packages myself, they were first compiled just like using any AUR-helper.

From version 7.1, the installation script for the AppImages is used, with the only difference that it points only to the version, while a second script will be downloaded, published separately, at [github.com/ivan-hc/AM/tree/main/appimage-bulder-scripts](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/tree/main/appimage-bulder-scripts), which will have the task of assembling the AppImage in the directory on the fly "tmp", during the installation process. When the second script has created the .AppImage file, the first script will continue the installation treating the created AppImage as a ready-made one downloaded from the internet.

In this video we see how "calibre" is installed (note that a "calibre.sh" file is downloaded during the process):

https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/assets/88724353/e439bd09-5ec6-4794-8b00-59735039caea

In this video, I run the aforementioned "calibre.sh" script in a separate directory, in a completely standalone way:

https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/assets/88724353/45844573-cecf-4107-b1d4-7e8fe3984eb1

Two different operations (assembly and installation) require two different scripts.

Fun fact, up until version 7, this option included a unique template that installed and assembled the AppImage on the fly (see [this video](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/assets/88724353/6ae38787-e0e5-4b63-b020-c89c1e975ddd)). This method has been replaced as it was too pretentious for a process, assembly, which may instead require many more steps, too many to be included in both an installation script and an update script (AM-updater).

#### Option Two: "Archives and other programs"
Option two is very similar to option zero. What changes is the number of questions, which allow you to customize both the application's .desktop file and the way a program should be extracted.

This script also supports extraction of *7z, *tar* and *zip files, if those archives are downloaded instead of a standalone binary.

By default, the install script does not have a launcher and icon. To create one, press "Y", otherwise, press "N" or leave it blank. This is useful if you want to load scripts or tools that can be used from the command line.

This option may be used also for AppImages, if you need to customize the launcher.

Tu add an icon, you need an URL to that, but if you don't have one, just leave blank. The script will download an icon from [portable-linux-apps.github.io](https://portable-linux-apps.github.io/) if it is hosted there, when running the installation script.

In this example, I'll use OBS Studio AppImage.

#### Option Three: "Firefox profiles"
Option 3 creates a launcher that opens Firefox in a custom profile and on a specific page, such as in a WebApp. I created this option to counterbalance the amount of Electron/Chrome-based applications (and because I'm a firm Firefox's supporter).

#### How an installation script works
The structure of an installation script is designed for a system-wide installation, with "AM", since it is intended to be hosted in the database. But every path indicated within it is written so that "AppMan" can patch the essential parts, to hijack the installation at a local level and without root privileges:
1. In the first step, the variables are indicated, such as the name of the application and a reference to the source of the app (mostly used in `--rollback` or `downgrade`);
2. Create the directory of the application;
3. The first file to be created is "`remove`", to quickly remove app's pieces in case of errors;
4. Create the "tmp" directory, in which the app will be downloaded and, in the case of archives, extracted;
5. Most scripts contain a "$version" variable, a command to intercept the URL to download the app. If the URL is linear and without univoque versions, "$version" can be used to detect a version number. Then save the value into a file "version" (this is important for the updates, see point 7);
6. Downloading the application (and extract it in case of archive);
7. Create the "AM-updater" file, the script used to update the app. It resumes points 4, 5 and 6, with the difference that the "$version" variable we have saved at point 5 is compared with a new value, hosted at the app's source;
8. Creation/extract/download launcher and icon, the methods change depending on the type of application. For AppImages they are extracted from the package.

#### How to test an installation script
To install and test your script, use the command
```
am -i /path/to/your-script
```
or
```
appman -i /path/to/your-script
```
To debug the installation, add the option `--debug`, like this
```
am -i --debug /path/to/your-script
```
or
```
appman -i --debug /path/to/your-script
```

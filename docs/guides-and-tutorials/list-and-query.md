### List and query all the applications available on the database
Option `-l` or `list` shows the whole list of apps available in this repository.

This option uses `less` to show the list, so to exit its enough to press "**Q**".

If the option `-l` is followed by `--appimages`, you will be able to see only the available AppImages.

Option `-q` or `query` shows search results from the list above.

If followed by `--appimages`, the search results will be only for the available AppImages.

If followed by `--pkg`, all keywords will be listed also if not on the same line. This is good if you are looking for multiple packages.

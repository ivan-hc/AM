## Using "AM" on freeBSD and derivatives

Since version 9.4, "AM" is compatible with BSD-based systems.

However, the compatibility of Linux programs on your BSD system must be done manually.

There are several guides on this subject, but I will try to adapt this one as much as possible to the use of Debian, which is the most familiar distribution for me.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Getting started
First we need to enable the Linux compatibility layer:
```
# sysrc linux_enable="YES"
```
Once enabled, it can be started without rebooting by executing the following command:
```
# service linux start
```
Then we need to install and use debootstrap, a program that can be used to install different Debian versions in a system without using an installation disk.
```
# pkg install debootstrap
```
Then we need to setup the correct installation path for debootstrap. Use your favorite text editor and insert the following line in /etc/sysctl.conf:
```
compat.linux.emul_path="/compat/debian"
```
Then we use debootstrap to install the Debian base tools for the Debian Bookworm version:
```
# debootstrap stable /compat/debian
```
In order for the contents of the home directory to be shared and in order to be able to run X11 applications, the directories /home and /tmp should be mounted in the Linux compat area using nullfs for loopback.

Edit /etc/fstab and insert the following:
```
# Device        Mountpoint              FStype          Options                      Dump    Pass#
devfs           /compat/debian/dev      devfs           rw,late                      0       0
tmpfs           /compat/debian/dev/shm  tmpfs           rw,late,size=1g,mode=1777    0       0
fdescfs         /compat/debian/dev/fd   fdescfs         rw,late,linrdlnk             0       0
linprocfs       /compat/debian/proc     linprocfs       rw,late                      0       0
linsysfs        /compat/debian/sys      linsysfs        rw,late                      0       0
/tmp            /compat/debian/tmp      nullfs          rw,late                      0       0
/home           /compat/debian/home     nullfs          rw,late                      0       0
```
Then execute mount in order to mount everything:
```
# mount -al
```
Now we're ready to use chroot to access the Linux system:
```
# chroot /compat/debian /bin/bash
```
We can use the uname command to verify that we are located in a Linux environment:
```
# uname -b
Linux 6.1.119 x86_64
```
Exit the chroot environment by typing exit
```
exit
```
...and edit and update the APT repositories located in /compat/debian/etc/apt/sources.list:
```
deb https://deb.debian.org/debian stable contrib main
deb https://deb.debian.org/debian stable-updates contrib main
deb https://deb.debian.org/debian stable-backports contrib main
deb https://deb.debian.org/debian-security stable-security contrib main
```
I also prefer to disable recommended and suggested packages in /compat/debian/etc/apt/apt.conf:
```
APT::Install-Recommends "false";
APT::AutoRemove::RecommendsImportant "false";
APT::AutoRemove::SuggestsImportant "false";
```
Then we go back into the chroot environment and update APT:
```
# chroot /compat/debian /bin/bash
# apt update
```
If you get a lot of packages that need upgrading, you can do that before you continue with:
```
# apt full-upgrade
```
Exit the chroot and run a program you have installed using "AM"/"AppMan" and check the error messages for missing libraries and packages.

If you have any doubts, install those packages that end with "-dev", so you can be sure you have all the libraries needed to run these programs.

To install them, enter the chroot again and install the missing dependencies with APT
```
# chroot /compat/debian /bin/bash
# apt install {package}
```

## Troubleshooting
This section lists common problems that may arise. "AM" does not guarantee miracles.

### ELF interpreter error
If you get the error:
```
ELF interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 not found, error 2
```
Then fix this by doing the following as root outside the chroot:
```
# cd /compat/debian/lib64/
# rm ./ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
# ln -s ../lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
```
Then run again the program installed with "AM"/"AppMan" as the regular user.

If the problem with ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 persists, then reboot FreeBSD before you continue.

### Chromium-based applications
Run Chromium-based apps with the `--no-sandbox` flag, for example
```
$ brave --no-sandbox
```

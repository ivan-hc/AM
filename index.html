<h1 id="introducing-am-">Introducing &quot;AM&quot;</h1>
<p>This project is the set of two Command Line Interfaces that coexist in the same body, &quot;<a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/blob/main/APP-MANAGER">APP-MANAGER</a>&quot;. This script, depending on how it is installed and renamed, allows you to install and manage any AppImage package, but also the official versions of Firefox, Thunderbird, Brave, Blender and hundreds of other programs provided on their official sites... in the same way but with different installation methods, at system level as super user or locally. These two CLIs, or entities, are &quot;AM&quot; (<code>am</code> command) and &quot;AppMan&quot; (<code>appman</code> command), respectively.</p>
<p><strong>This repository is focused on using &quot;AM&quot; and contains the full database of the installation scripts for the applications managed by both &quot;AM&quot; and &quot;AppMan&quot;!</strong></p>
<p><em>For specific guide on using &quot;AppMan&quot;, see <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan">https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan</a></em></p>

<p>Being &quot;<a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/blob/main/APP-MANAGER">APP-MANAGER</a>&quot; a bash-based script, it can be used on all the architectures supported by the Linux kernel and works with all the GNU/Linux distributions.</p>
<p>&quot;AM&quot;/&quot;AppMan&quot; aims to be a merger for GNU/Linux distributions, using not just AppImage as the main package format, but also other standalone programs, so without having to risk breaking anything on your system: no daemons, no shared libraries. Just your program!</p>
<p>The main goal of this tool is to provide the same updated applications to multiple GNU/Linux distributions without having to change the package manager or the distro itself. This means that whatever distro you use, you will not miss your favorite programs or the need for a more updated version.</p>

<details>
  <summary></summary>

Initially the two projects traveled in parallel to each other, until version 5, in which the codes merged. However, depending on whether it is installed permanently using a specific method (&quot;AM&quot;) or downloaded portablely (&quot;AppMan&quot;, if renamed &quot;<code>appman</code>&quot;) the two CLIs work slightly differently.

#### In short:

- &quot;<strong>AM</strong>&quot; applies system-wide programs integration (for all users), i.e. installs programs in the <code>/opt</code> directory (see <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch03s13.html">Linux Standard Base</a>), the launchers instead are installed in <code>/usr/share/applications</code> (or <code>/usr/local/share/applications</code> if the distribution is &quot;immutable&quot;) with the &quot;AM-&quot; suffix and the links are placed in <code>/usr/local/bin</code> or <code>/usr/local/games</code>. To manage programs system wide, AM needs to be installed in <code>/opt/am</code> as &quot;<code>APP-MANAGER</code>&quot; with a <code>/usr/local/bin/am</code> as a symlink (see <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM#installation">https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM#installation</a>);
- &quot;<strong>AppMan</strong>&quot;, on the other hand, works in a portable way and allows you to install and manage the same applications locally, in your &quot;$HOME&quot; directory, and without root privileges. However, it is important that it is renamed to <code>appman</code> to work (see <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan#installation">https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan#installation</a>)

<strong><em>NOTE, &quot;AM&quot; can be set to work like &quot;AppMan&quot; by enabling an alias provided with the command &quot;<code>am --user</code>&quot;.</em></strong>

#### To be more detailed, here is an overview of how apps are installed by &quot;AM&quot; and &quot;AppMan&quot;

Where <code>$PROGRAM</code> is the application we&#39;re going to install:
- &quot;AM&quot; (ie the <code>am</code> command) installs programs system-wide. &quot;AM&quot; requires the <code>sudo</code> privileges but only to install and remove the app, all the other commands can be executed as a normal user. This allows multiple users of the same system to be able to use the same installed applications. This is what an installation script installs with &quot;AM&quot;:

      /opt/$PROGRAM/
      /opt/$PROGRAM/$PROGRAM
      /opt/$PROGRAM/AM-updater
      /opt/$PROGRAM/remove
      /opt/$PROGRAM/icons/$ICON-NAME
      /usr/local/bin/$PROGRAM
      /usr/share/applications/AM-$PROGRAM.desktop
If the distro is immutable instead, the path of the launcher (the last line above) will change like this:

      /usr/local/share/applications/AM-$PROGRAM.desktop
Since version 5.1 the installation process have introduced a check to find read-only filesystems (<code>grep &quot;[[:space:]]ro[[:space:],]&quot; /proc/mounts</code>), if there are mountpoints like this, your distro may be an immutable one, so an <code>/usr/local/share/applications</code> directory will be created and the installation script will be patched to redirect the installation of launchers in that path to solve the issue.

- &quot;AppMan&quot; (ie the <code>appman</code> command) instead does not need root privileges to work, it allows you to choose where to install your applications into your <code>$HOME</code> directory. AppMan is also usable as a portable app (i.e. you can download and place it wherever you want) and it is able to update itself, anywhere! At first start it will ask you where to install the apps and it will create the directory for you (the configuration file is in <code>~/.config/appman</code>). For example, suppose you want install everything in &quot;Applicazioni&quot; (the italian of &quot;applications&quot;), this is the structure of what an installation scripts installs with &quot;AppMan&quot; instead:

      ~/Applicazioni/$PROGRAM/
      ~/Applicazioni/$PROGRAM/$PROGRAM
      ~/Applicazioni/$PROGRAM/AM-updater
      ~/Applicazioni/$PROGRAM/remove
      ~/Applicazioni/$PROGRAM/icons/$ICON-NAME
      ~/.local/bin/$PROGRAM
      ~/.local/share/applications/AM-$PROGRAM.desktop

For everything else, the controls and operation are always the same for both command line tools. The only thing that changes is that the installation scripts are written only for &quot;AM&quot;, while &quot;AppMan&quot; uses the same scripts and includes commands that can modify them to make them work locally during the installation process.

<details>
  <summary></summary>

If you usa &quot;AM&quot; and have the needing of installing apps at system level and locally, use the option <code>--user</code> that allows you to create an alias to install and manage apps in your $HOME folder. When executing the <code>am --user</code> command you will be suggested an alias to use temporarily or if you want you can add it in your ~/.bashrc to make it permanent. &quot;AppMan&quot; will be used while still using the usual <code>am</code> command.

The <code>--user</code> option does not immediately enable &quot;AppMan Mode&quot;, instead it will show you an alias to use temporarily in the current session or to add to your ~/.bashrc to make it permanent:
<code>alias am=/opt/am/appman</code>
AppMan is downloaded to the AM&#39;s installation folder, but without affecting the existing installation.

<strong><em>NOTE: using AM with the <code>--user</code> option enabled and the alias for AppMan, &quot;sudo&quot; allows normal use of AM, absence allows use of AppMan.</em></strong>

&quot;AM&quot;/&quot;AppMan&quot; installs/removes/updates/manages only standalone programs, ie those programs that can be run from a single directory in which they are contained (where <code>$PROGRAM</code> is the name of the application, &quot;AM&quot; installs them always into a dedicated folder named <code>/opt/$PROGRAM</code>, while &quot;AppMan&quot; lets you choose to install them in a dedicated directory in your <code>$HOME</code>).

The &quot;AM&quot; repository aims to be a reference point where you can download all the AppImage packages scattered around the web, otherwise unobtainable, as you would expect from any package manager, through specific installation scripts for each application, as happens with the AUR PKGBUILDs, on Arch Linux. &quot;AM&quot; is intended to be a kind of Arch User Repository (AUR) of AppImage packages, providing them a home to stay. An both &quot;AM&quot; and &quot;AppMan&quot; are the key of this home. Visit...

... for more!

### STANDALONE PROGRAMS
The programs are taken:
- from official sources (see Firefox, Thunderbird, Blender, NodeJS, Chromium Latest, Platform Tools...);
- extracted from official .deb/tar/zip packages;
- from the repositories and official sites of individual developers.

### APPIMAGES
The vast majority of scripts target AppImage packages:
- from official sources (if the upstream developers provide them);
- from AppImage recipes to be compiled on-the-fly with <a href="https://github.com/AppImage/pkg2appimage">pkg2appimage</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit">appimagetool</a>;
- from unofficial third-party developers, but only if an official release is not available.

You can consult basic information, links to sites and sources used through the related <code>am -a $PROGRAM</code> command.

### FIREFOX PROFILES
You even create Firefox profiles to run as webapps, the ones with suffix &quot;ffwa-&quot; in the apps list.

### THIRD-PARTY LIBRARIES
From version 5.8 it is also possible to install <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/tree/main/libraries">third-party libraries</a> if they are not provided in your distribution&#39;s repositories.

The full list is <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/blob/main/libraries/libs-list">here</a>.

<h2 id="how-to-update-all-programs-for-real">How to update all programs, for real</h2>
<details>
  <summary></summary>

To update all the programs and &quot;AM&quot; itself, just run the command (without <code>sudo</code>):

    am -u

To update only the programs:

    am -u --apps

To update just one program:

    am -u $PROGRAM

Here are the ways in which the updates will be made:
- Updateable AppImages can rely on an <a href="https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageUpdate">appimageupdatetool</a>-based &quot;updater&quot; or on their external zsync file (if provided by the developer);
- Non-updateable AppImages and other standalone programs will be replaced only with a more recent version if available, this will be taken by comparing the installed version with the one available on the source (using &quot;curl&quot;, &quot;grep&quot; and &quot;cat&quot;), the same is for some AppImages created with <a href="https://github.com/AppImage/pkg2appimage">pkg2appimage</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit">appimagetool</a>;
- Fixed versions will be listed with their build number (e.g. $PROGRAM-1.1.1). Note that most of the programs are updateable, so fixed versions will only be added upon request (or if it is really difficult to find a right wget/curl command to download the latest version).

<strong><em>NOTE, with &quot;AM&quot;, during the first installation, the main user (<code>$currentuser</code>) will take the necessary permissions on each <code>/opt/$PROGRAM</code> directory, in this way all updates will be automatic and without root permissions.</em></strong>

###### <em>In this video I&#39;ll show you how to test an update on &quot;Avidemux&quot; using &quot;AM&quot; (I use my custom AppImage I have built from &quot;deb-multimedia&quot;, for my use case, but don&#39;t worry, the official Avidemux AppImage is also available on this repository). Firefox, on the other hand, is not affected by this management, as it can be updated automatically</em>:

<h2 id="comparison-with-other-appimage-managers">Comparison with other AppImage managers</h2>
<details>
  <summary></summary>

- There are many other AppImage managers around, and almost all of them support their database on appimagehub or other official AppImage resources, but the big problem is at the base of the compilation of these packages, being very often without an integrated update system. Furthermore, AppImage is a format that many developers are abandoning in favor of Flatpak, also because there were no centralized repositories or software that managed its updates in a universal way... at least until the invention of the first draft of <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan">AppMan</a>;
- With &quot;AM&quot;/&quot;AppMan&quot; each installed program has its own script (AM-updater) that compares the installed version with the one available in the sources or uses official tools to update the AppImages (<a href="#how-to-update-all-programs-for-real">see above</a>), there is support for multiple architectures (including i686 and aarch64) and anyone can create a script to install that particular program (if available for its architecture).

Don&#39;t worry, if you come across one of these programs, a message will warn you that the program cannot be installed, skipping the installation process just for that script:
- &quot;<code>binutils</code>&quot;, contains a series of basic commands, including &quot;<code>ar</code>&quot; which extracts .deb packages (which are very few here);
- &quot;<code>unzip</code>&quot;, to extract .zip packages;
- &quot;<code>tar</code>&quot;, to extract .tar* packages;
- &quot;<code>zsync</code>&quot;, about 10% of AppImages depend on this to be updated.

Since 2.3.1 release &quot;AM&quot; has its inbuilt bash completion script that can be enabled using the following command:

    am --enable-completion
This will ceate a bash completion script in /etc/bash_completion.d named <code>am-completion.sh</code> needed to complete a keyword with the TAB key using the names of all the main options and the name of the scripts of all the applications available in the &quot;AM&quot; repository.
To disable bash completion (and to remove the /etc/bash_completion.d/am-completion.sh script):

    am --disable-completion
Here you are a video on how to disable/enable bash completion in &quot;AM&quot;:

Since 2.6.1 release, &quot;AM&quot; supports snapshots of all installed applications. A selected program can be copied locally into your home folder.

Here you are a video on how to backup/restore works in &quot;AM&quot;:

<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88724353/157094646-0e29ddbe-6cb7-4880-8414-110db071e617.mp4">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88724353/157094646-0e29ddbe-6cb7-4880-8414-110db071e617.mp4</a>

- option <code>-b</code> or <code>backup</code> creates the snapshot, usage:

      am -b $PROGRAM
- option <code>-o</code> or <code>overwrite</code> allows you to roll back to a previous version of the program. Usage:

      am -o $PROGRAM
All the snapshots are stored into an hidden <code>/home/$USER/.am-snapshots</code> folder containing other subfolders, each one has the name of the programs you&#39;ve done a backup before. Each snapshot is named with the date and time you have done the backup. To restore the application to a previous version, copy/paste the name of the snapshot when the <code>-o</code> option will prompt it.

<h3 id="convert-old-type2-appimages-to-type3">Convert old Type2 AppImages to Type3</h3>
<details>
  <summary></summary>

Since version 6.1 it is possible to convert old Type2 AppImages (dependent on <code>libfuse2</code>) to Type3 using the option <code>nolibfuse</code>.
<code>am nolibfuse ${PROGRAM}</code>
First the selected program type is checked, if it is a Type2 AppImage, it will be extracted and repackaged using the new version of <code>appimagetool</code> from <a href="https://github.com/probonopd/go-appimage">https://github.com/probonopd/go-appimage</a> :
- If the installed AppImage can be updated via <code>zsync</code>, the update will take place while maintaining the status of Type3 AppImage;
- On the contrary, if the update occurs through &quot;comparison&quot; of versions, the converted AppImage will be replaced by the upstream version, which could still be Type2. But from version 6.1.1 the command is added within the application&#39;s AM-updater script, so as to automatically start the conversion at each update (prolonging the update time, depending on the size of the AppImage). <strong>I suggest anyone to contact the developers to update the packaging method of their AppImage!</strong>

NOTE, the conversion is not always successful, a lot depends on how the program is packaged. The conversion occurs in two steps:
- if in the first case it succeeds without problems, the package will be repackaged as it was, but of Type 3 (and the AM-updater script will be patched if a .zsync file doesn&#39;t exist);
- if the script encounters problems (due to Appstream validation), it will attempt to delete the contents of the /usr/share/metainfo directory inside the AppImage, as a workaround (which will probably make updates via <code>zsync</code> unusable);
- if this step does not succeed either, the process will end with an error and the AppImage will remain Type2.

<details>
  <summary></summary>

Since version 5.3 you can use the <code>--firejail</code> option to run AppImages using a sandbox (requires Firejail installed on the host).

At first start a copy of /etc/firejail/default.profile will be saved in your application&#39;s directory, so you&#39;re free to launch the AppImage once using the default Firejail profile (option 1) or the custom one (2), you can also patch the .desktop files (if available) to in sandbox-mode always (options 3 and 4). You can handle the custom firejail.profile file of the app using <code>vim</code> or <code>nano</code> using the option 5 (the first selection is <code>vim</code>).

Options 1, 2 and 5 are continuous to let you edit the file and test your changes immediately. Press any key to exit.

NOTE: once patched the .desktop files (options 3 and 4), they will be placed in ~/.local/share/applications, this means that if you have installed apps using AppMan, the original launchers will be overwrited.

&quot;AM&quot;/&quot;AppMan&quot; has a <code>-t</code> option (or <code>template</code>) with which you can get a script to customize according to your needs. With this option, you can quickly create scripts to download existing programs or even create AppImage or AppDirs through tools such as <a href="https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit">appimagetool</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AppImage/pkg2appimage">pkg2appimage</a>.

The following video shows how to create and test an AppImage of &quot;Abiword&quot; from Debian Unstable repository with a custom AppRun (option 5):

<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88724353/150619523-a45455f6-a656-4753-93fe-aa99babc1083.mp4">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88724353/150619523-a45455f6-a656-4753-93fe-aa99babc1083.mp4</a>

The currently available templates are stored <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/tree/main/templates">here</a>.

A wiki is also available, here I will try to explain the installation script&#39;s workflow for a program to be better managed by &quot;AM&quot;, trying to use a language that is as simple and elementary as possible.

Each script is written exclusively for &quot;AM&quot; and is structured in such a way that even &quot;<a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan">AppMan</a>&quot; can modify it to manage programs locally.

We can divide the stages of an installation&#39;s process as follows:

<em> <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/wiki/Step-1:-create-the-main-directory">Step 1: create the main directory</a> in /opt, as already suggested by the <a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/opt.html">Linux Standard Base</a> (LSB);
</em> <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/wiki/Step-2:-create-the-%22remove%22-script">Step 2: create the &quot;remove&quot; script</a>, needed to uninstall averything (this must be the first one to be created, in order to quickly resolve any aborted/brocken installations using the <code>-r</code> option);
<em> <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/wiki/Step-3:-download-the-program">Step 3: download the program</a> and/or compile the program (this operation varies depending on how the program is distributed);
</em> <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/wiki/Step-4:-link-to-a-$PATH">Step 4: link to a $PATH</a> (usually <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, but also <code>/usr/bin</code>, <code>/usr/games</code> or <code>/usr/local/games</code>);
<em> <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/wiki/Step-5:-the-%22AM-updater%22-script">Step 5: the &quot;AM updater&quot; script</a>, which is a kind of &quot;copy&quot; of step &quot;3&quot; (see above) that may include options to recognize newer versions of the program. NOTE that if you intend to create a script for the fixed version of a program, you can also skip this step;
</em> <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/wiki/Step-6:-launchers-and-icons">Step 6: launchers and icons</a>. Note that if you intend to create a script for a command line utility, you can also skip this step;
<em> <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/wiki/Step-7:-permissions">Step 7: change the permissions</a> in the program folder, so you can use the update function (step 5) without using &quot;sudo&quot; privileges
</em> <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/wiki/Step-8-(optional">Step 8 (optional): your signature</a>:-your-signature)

The most difficult step to overcome is certainly the number &quot;3&quot;, given the great variety of methods in which authors distribute their software, while all the other steps are much easier to overcome.

To install and test your own script, use the command <code>am -i /path/to/your-script</code> or <code>appman -i /path/to/your-script</code> depending on your CLI

If by running it in the terminal you get an error message about &quot;FUSE&quot; or &quot;libfuse&quot;/&quot;libfuse2&quot; missing, take a look at the official documentation:

<a href="https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/troubleshooting/fuse.html">https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/troubleshooting/fuse.html</a>

If your distro does not provide <code>libfuse2</code>, you can install it using the command:
<code>am -i libfuse2</code>
or
<code>appman -i libfuse2</code>
NOTE, in AppMan you still need to use your password (<code>sudo</code>) to install the library at system level, in /usr/local/lib

Alternatively you can use the &quot;<code>nolibfuse</code>&quot; option to &quot;try&quot; to convert old Type2 AppImages to Type3, so as not to depend on <code>libfuse2</code>. In most cases it works, but sometimes it can give errors, depending on how the package was manufactured.

However, I suggest contacting the upstream developers to convince them to upgrade their packages to Type3.

Before installing any application, try to know where it comes from first. This program provides you with two basic options for this purpose:
- Option <code>-a</code> or <code>about</code> (medium safety), allows you to read a short description and know the links from the pages of the site <a href="https://portable-linux-apps.github.io">https://portable-linux-apps.github.io</a> locally, however these links may be inaccurate due to continuous updates of the initial scripts (you can provide additional info yourself by modifying the pages of the site, <a href="https://github.com/Portable-Linux-Apps/Portable-Linux-Apps.github.io">here</a>, it is also open source);
- Option <code>-d</code> or <code>download</code> (absolute safety), this allows you to get the installation script directly on your desktop, so you can read the mechanisms and how it performs the downloads from the sources (in most cases there is a header for each step that explains what the listed commands do).

“AM” and AppMan are just tools to easily install all listed programs, but what you choose to install is your complete responsibility. <strong>Use at your own risk</strong>!

Some developers insist on creating Appimages that create their own launcher on first launch (like WALC and OpenShot). If the official solution proposed <a href="https://discourse.appimage.org/t/stop-appimage-from-asking-to-integrate/488">here</a> doesn&#39;t work, create a .home directory with the <code>-H</code> option, launch the app and accept the request. For example (with &quot;AM&quot;):
<code>am -H walc
walc</code>
Accept the integration request, the launcher will be saved in the walc.home directory located next to the AppImage file.

This is a choice I made as many developers have abandoned support for AppImage or GNU/Linux in general. My aim here is to introduce you to other developers&#39; applications, then it&#39;s up to you to contact them, support them, help improve the software through forks and pull requests, opening issues and encouraging developers to keep the software in the format you prefer.

In case you are sure that the upstream developer will maintain the package for each stable release, you can fix this in several ways:
#### Method 1: Direct installation by combining <code>-d</code> and <code>-i</code> options 
<code>am -d $PROGRAM
sed -i &#39;s#releases -O -#releases/latest -O -#g&#39; $(xdg-user-dir DESKTOP)/$PROGRAM
am -i $(xdg-user-dir DESKTOP)/$PROGRAM</code>
#### Method 2: &quot;Downgrade&quot; the installed app to &quot;latest&quot;
Use the option <code>--force-latest</code> to patch the AM-updater and perform the &quot;update&quot;/&quot;downgrade&quot;:
<code>am --force-latest $PROGRAM</code>
or do it manually:
<code>sed -i &#39;s#releases -O -#releases/latest -O -#g&#39; /opt/$PROGRAM/AM-updater

<details>
  <summary></summary>

With the arrival of Fedora 40 in April 2024, many users began to complain about the inability to download any application from github and the inability to update modules (see <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/issues/496">https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/issues/496</a>). This is because &quot;wget&quot; is no longer actively developed, and its successor &quot;wget2&quot; was not yet ready to take its place immediately. Yet the Fedora team decided to replace it anyway, causing quite a few problems for this project and many others that use api.github.com to function.

Attempts to add patches to avoid having dependencies like <code>jq</code> added and to rewrite all the scripts to promptly adapt them to more versatile solutions were in vain.

So I decided to host on this repository the &quot;wget&quot; binaries directly from Debian 12 (see <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/tree/main/tools/x86_64">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/tree/main/tools/aarch64">here</a>), and the installation scripts dedicated to them, for the <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/blob/main/programs/x86_64/wget">x86_64</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/blob/main/programs/x86_64/wget">aarch64</a> architectures and which use &quot;wget2&quot; to download the executable.

Run the command
<code>am -i wget</code>
NOTE, the binary is called from a script in /usr/local/bin that runs &quot;wget&quot; with the &quot;--no-check-certificate&quot; option. It&#39;s not the best of solutions, but it&#39;s enough to suppress this shortcoming while the compatibility issue between wget and wget2 will not be completely resolved.

 Choose how to install \"AM\" and all its managed applications.

 1) As \"${RED}AM\033[0m\", command \"${Green}am\033[0m\", this is a system-wide installation:
   - the command is a symlink /usr/local/bin/am for /opt/am/APP-MANAGER
   - install and manage both system (default, require \"root\") and local apps
   - choose wherever you want to install local apps
   - you are the one with read-write permissions for \"AM\" and system programs
   - other users can only use programs you have installed, nothing else
   - other users can still use \"AppMan mode\" for their rootless configurations

 2) As \"${LightBlue}AppMan\033[0m\", command \"${Green}appman\033[0m\", local installation:
   - the command is the script ~/.local/bin/appman
   - install and manage only local apps
   - choose wherever you want to install local apps
   - you can replicate your configurations on every system you want
   - more storage space required, if more users use \"AppMan\"

			NAME: ${Green}$AMCLIUPPER\033[0m		VERSION: ${Green}$AMVERSION\033[0m

			SYNOPSIS:	${LightBlue}$AMCLI {OPTION}\033[0m
					${LightBlue}$AMCLI {OPTION} {PROGRAM}\033[0m

			DESCRIPTION: A command line utility to install and manage AppImages and other portable programs for GNU/Linux thanks to its AUR-inspired database.

			OPTIONS:

			${Gold}about, -a\033[0m

					${LightBlue}$AMCLI -a {PROGRAM}\033[0m

			Description: Shows more info about one or more apps.

			${Gold}apikey\033[0m

					${LightBlue}$AMCLI apikey {Github Token}
					${LightBlue}$AMCLI apikey delete\033[0m

			Description: Accede to github APIs using your personal access tokens. The file named \"ghapikey.txt\" will be saved in $AMDATADIR. Use \"del\" to remove it.

			${Gold}backup, -b\033[0m

					${LightBlue}$AMCLI -b {PROGRAM}\033[0m

			Description: Create a snapshot of the current version of an installed program.

			${Gold}clean, -c\033[0m

					${LightBlue}$AMCLI -c\033[0m

			Description: Removes all the unnecessary files and folders.

			${Gold}config, -C, --config\033[0m

					${LightBlue}$AMCLI -C {PROGRAM}\033[0m

			Description: Set a dedicated \$XDG_CONFIG_HOME for one or more AppImages.

			${Gold}downgrade, --rollback\033[0m

					${LightBlue}$AMCLI --rollback {PROGRAM}\033[0m

			Description: Download an older or specific app version.

			${Gold}download, -d\033[0m

					${LightBlue}$AMCLI -d {PROGRAM}
					${LightBlue}$AMCLI -d --convert {PROGRAM}\033[0m

			Description: Download one or more installation scripts to your desktop or convert them to local installers for \"AppMan\". To test the scripts, use the \"${LightBlue}$AMCLI -i '/path/to/script'\033[0m\" command or enter the directory of the script and run the \"${LightBlue}$AMCLI -i ./script\033[0m\" command, even using dedicated flags, if necessary (see \"-i\").

			${Gold}extra, -e\033[0m

					${LightBlue}$AMCLI -e user/project {APPNAME}
					${LightBlue}$AMCLI -e user/project {APPNAME} {KEYWORD}\033[0m

			Description: Install AppImages from github.com, outside the database. This allows you to install, update and manage them all like the others. Where \"user/project\" can be the whole URL to the github repository, give a name to the program so that it can be used from the command line. Optionally, add an \"univoque\" keyword if multiple AppImages are listed.

			${Gold}files, -f, -fi\033[0m

					${LightBlue}$AMCLI -f
					${LightBlue}$AMCLI -f --byname
					${LightBlue}$AMCLI -f --less\033[0m

			Description: Shows the list of all installed programs, with sizes. By default apps are sorted by size, use \"--byname\" to sort by name. With the option \"--less\" it shows only the number of installed apps. Option \"-fi\" only shows installed apps, not the AppImages integrated with the \"--launcher\" option.

			${Gold}help, -h\033[0m

					${LightBlue}$AMCLI -h\033[0m

			Description: Prints this message.

			${Gold}hide\033[0m

			${Gold}-HC, -CH\033[0m

					${LightBlue}$AMCLI -HC {PROGRAM}\033[0m

			Description: Set dedicated \$HOME and \$XDG_CONFIG_HOME directories for one or more AppImages.

			${Gold}icons, --icons\033[0m

					${LightBlue}$AMCLI --icons {PROGRAM}
					${LightBlue}$AMCLI --icons --all\033[0m

			Description: Allow installed apps to use system icon themes. You can specify the name of the apps to change or use the \"--all\" flag to change all of them at once.

					${LightBlue}$AMCLI -ias {PROGRAM}\033[0m

			Description: Same as \"install\" (see above) but for AppImages only. Option \"-ias\" (aka Install AppImage & Sandbox) is equivalent to \"-ia --sandbox\", to set sandboxes for AppImage packages.

					${LightBlue}$AMCLI --launcher /path/to/\${APPIMAGE}\033[0m

			Description: Drag/drop one or more AppImages in the terminal and embed them in the apps menu and customize a command to use from the CLI.

			NOTE that \"--launcher\" can be used as a flag in \"-u\" to try to update the integrated AppImages (see \"-u\"). This works only if \"appimageupdatetool\" is installed and delta updates are supported. This flag does not work miracles, I strongly suggest to use options \"-ia\" and \"-e\" instead.

			${Gold}--system\033[0m

					${LightBlue}am --system\033[0m

			${Gold}--user\033[0m

					${LightBlue}am --user\033[0m

			Description: Made \"AM\" run in \"AppMan Mode\", locally, useful for unprivileged users. This option only works with \"AM\".

			The \"--user\" option can also be used just as a flag for installation options. For example:

			- Use it to install applications locally, option \"-i\" or \"install\":

				${LightBlue}am -i --user {PROGRAM}\033[0m

			- Also suboptions of \"-i\" can work with this flag:

				${LightBlue}am -i --user --debug {PROGRAM}\033[0m
				${LightBlue}am -i --user --force-latest {PROGRAM}
				${LightBlue}am -i --user --icons {PROGRAM}
				${LightBlue}am -i --user --debug --force-latest {PROGRAM}
				${LightBlue}am -i --user --debug --force-latest --icons {PROGRAM}\033[0m

			- Same for AppImages only, option \"-ia\" or \"install-appimage\":

				${LightBlue}am -ia --user {PROGRAM}\033[0m
				${LightBlue}am -ia --user --debug {PROGRAM}
				${LightBlue}am -ia --user --force-latest {PROGRAM}
				${LightBlue}am -ia --user --icons {PROGRAM}
				${LightBlue}am -ia --user --debug --force-latest {PROGRAM}\033[0m
				${LightBlue}am -ia --user --debug --force-latest --icons {PROGRAM}\033[0m

			- External AppImages can be installed like this as well, option \"-e\" or \"extra\":

				${LightBlue}am -e --user user/project {APPNAME}\033[0m
				${LightBlue}am -e --user user/project {APPNAME} {KEYWORD}\033[0m

			NOTE, \"AM\" 9 or higher is also able to, update and manage apps locally, by default, and without having to switch to \"AppMan Mode\".

			Description: Switch \"AM\" back to \"AM\" from \"AppMan Mode\" (see \"--user\").

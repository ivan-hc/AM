This section stores some extra tools:
- am2plasite, a script to update main pages of https://portable-linux-apps.github.io using the application's list from this repo
- pkg2appimage (lite version), a lightweight fork of [pkg2appimage](https://github.com/AppImage/pkg2appimage) that runs on systems without libfuse2
- REPO-sample.zip contains templates I use to quick create my repositories, where I create AppImages

Other scripts or binaries can be added as appropriate.

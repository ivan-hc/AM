 
 AppImage SAndboxing Project (pronounced /eɪsæp/): a Go library 
 to help sandbox AppImages through bwrap.
 VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT! Many parts of this are subject to change 
 and should be expected to until it reaches a more stable form.
 
 aisap intends to be a simple way to implement Android/Flatpak 
 style sandboxing with AppImages. It has a profile system, but it 
 intends to keep it as basic as possible, making it easier to 
 understand what a program actually requires to run without 
 dealing with the hassle of individually cherry-picking files.
 
 It currently has a basic re-implementaion of the go-appimage API,
 so modifying existing GoLang programs to include sandboxing 
 should be fairly painless.
 
 USAGE: `aisap $APPIMAGE`

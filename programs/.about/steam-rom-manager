 Steam ROM Manager is a super flexible tool for adding
 non-Steam games to steam in bulk and managing their
 artwork assets. Added games could be ROMs for emulators,
 games from other stores such as Epic or GOG, or even not
 games at all. Have you always wanted your notes from
 junior year as a category in steam? If so that's pretty
 weird! But now it's possible.

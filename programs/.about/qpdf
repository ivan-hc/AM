 QPDF is a command-line tool and C++ library that performs 
 content-preserving transformations on PDF files. 
 It supports linearization, encryption, and numerous other 
 features. It can also be used for splitting and merging 
 files, creating PDF files (but you have to supply all the 
 content yourself), and inspecting files for study or 
 analysis. QPDF does not render PDFs or perform text 
 extraction, and it does not contain higher-level interfaces 
 for working with page contents. It is a low-level tool for 
 working with the structure of PDF files and can be a 
 valuable tool for anyone who wants to do programmatic or 
 command-line-based manipulation of PDF files.

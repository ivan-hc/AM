 AppImageLauncher is a helper application for Linux distributions 
 serving as a kind of "entry point" for running and integrating 
 AppImages.
  AppImageLauncher plays well with other applications managing 
 AppImages, for example app stores. However, it doesn't depend on 
 any of those, and can run completely standalone.
 
 This script provides the command line version.
 USAGE: appimagelauncher --help
 
 NOTE, use the following command to open the graphical Settings 
 Manager of AppImageLauncher:
 
         "appimagelauncher AppImageLauncherSettings"
         
 and set a different path for your AppImages, as the default one
 is ~/Applications, while other tools managed by "AM" and AppMan
 can use different paths (for example "appimagedl").

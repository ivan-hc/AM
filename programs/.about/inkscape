 Inkscape is a Free and open source vector graphics editor for GNU/Linux,
 Windows and MacOS X. It offers a rich set of features and is widely used
 for both artistic and technical illustrations such as cartoons, clip art,
 logos, typography, diagramming and flowcharting. It uses vector graphics
 to allow for sharp printouts and renderings at unlimited resolution and is
 not bound to a fixed number of pixels like raster graphics. Inkscape uses
 the standardized SVG file format as its main format, which is supported by
 many other applications including web browsers.
 It can import and export various file formats, including SVG, AI, EPS, PDF,
 PS and PNG. It has a comprehensive feature set, a simple interface, multi-
 lingual support and is designed to be extensible; users can customize
 Inkscape's functionality with add-ons.

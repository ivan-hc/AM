 LMMS is a free cross-platform alternative to commercial programs like
 FL Studio®, which allow you to produce music with your computer. This
 includes the creation of melodies and beats, the synthesis and mixing
 of sounds, and arranging of samples. You can have fun with your MIDI-
 keyboard and much more... all in a user-friendly and modern interface.

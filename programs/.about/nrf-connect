 nRF Connect for Desktop is a cross-platform framework
 for desktop apps for development kits or dongles from
 Nordic Semiconductor. The framework provides a launcher
 and the general layout for selecting devices,
 navigation menus, logging, etc. Apps can decorate the
 standard components and use built-in libraries in order
 to create end-user tools.

 WINE - Compatibility layer to run MS Windows apps and games on GNU/Linux.
 
 "Staging" is the most recent testing wine version.
 This version is for both x86 and x64 MS Windows programs.
 
 USAGE: wine-staging winecfg (this will launch WINE Config)
        wine-staging uninstaller (this will launch Install/remove)
        wine-staging notepad (this will launch Notepad)
        wine-staging <program>.exe (to launch a any Windows program)
        
 NOTE that Q4wine and other profile managers for WINE may not recognize 
 this command, to solve this problem AM automatically creates a symbolic 
 link to this AppImage called /opt/wine-staging/wine which can be used by 
 the above profile managers.
 
 The "mmtrt" repository always provides the latest version for each of the 
 three development branches of WINE.

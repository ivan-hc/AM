 simple-uploader is a tool for easily uploading files
 and sharing links via AWS S3. The user enters their
 bucket name and credentials, then they can easily drop
 in files to be uploaded and are given a link to share
 that file with others. They can also delete files that
 they have uploaded from that device.

 
 As chief artificer Larry Lodestone, your goal is to make your
 way through the intricate designs of The Artifact. Your goal
 is to shut down the core, which has gone haywire. However, the
 way in is filled with obstacles, as weird orbs spawned by the
 malfunctioning core are disrupting and reconstructing the matrix
 of The Artifact.
 Before you can reach the core, these orbs must be isolated to
 prevent further damage.

 In Artifact, your goal is to make your way through 40 levels of
 mayhem without getting destroyed, racking up as many points as
 possible on the way. Each level consists of a screen filled with
 a variety of different orbs. These orbs must be isolated by the
 player. Once 75% of the playing field has been isolated, the
 level ends, and the player moves on to the score and powerup
 allocation screen. The player controls the dual-direction Welding
 Blaster that can be rotated to fire vertically or horizontally.
 When fired, a welding beam will slowly traverse the screen in 2 
 directions. Once both ends reach a wall, the playing field will 
 be cut, isolating balls on each side of the beam. However, care
 must be taken not to hit the orbs, as they will create a feedback
 surge, damaging the Welding Blaster. Once the Welding Blaster
 reaches critical damage, it will explode, and the game will be
 over. For every level a number of new orbs will be added to the
 game. These can be of any type depending on the level.

 Zograscope is mainly a syntax-aware diff that also provides
 a number of additional tools. 
 
 The nature of syntax-aware diff requires knowledge of structure
 of the code, which can be used to build other simple tools that 
 can benefit from this information. Competing with real language 
 front-ends in the level of accuracy is not possible, but making 
 some things that are one step further than regular 
 text-processing utilities seems feasible and the result might be 
 even more practical than some of the more elaborate tools which 
 end up requiring complicated setup process.
 
 The project is work in progress, but is useful in its current 
 state.

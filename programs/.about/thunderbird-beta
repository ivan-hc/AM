 Thunderbird is an mail client suitable for free distribution. 
 The goal of Thunderbird is to produce a cross platform stand-alone 
 mail application using the XUL user interface language. It supports 
 different mail accounts, no matter of the used protocol like POP(s) 
 or IMAP(s), has an integrated learning Spam filter, and offers easy 
 organization of mails with tagging and virtual folders. Also, more 
 features can be added by installing extensions.
  
 Thunderbird also includes an integrated calendar for handling events,
 events invitations and tasks in multiple calendars. It supports local 
 calendars, CalDAV and plain ics files on CardDAV and WebDAV.
  
 This is the official BETA build with automatic updates.

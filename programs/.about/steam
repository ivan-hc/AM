 Steam is a video game digital distribution service by Valve.  It 
 was launched as a standalone software client in September 2003 
 as a way for Valve to provide automatic updates for their games, 
 and expanded to include games from third-party publishers.
 Steam has also expanded into an online web-based and mobile 
 digital storefront. Steam offers digital rights management (DRM),
 server hosting, video streaming, and social networking services.
 It also provides the user with installation and automatic 
 updating of games, and community features such as friends lists 
 and groups, cloud storage, and in-game voice and chat 
 functionality. 
 
 This is the AppImage version built from the official .deb package.

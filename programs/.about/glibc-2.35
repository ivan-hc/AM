 The GNU C Library project provides the core libraries for
 the GNU system and GNU/Linux systems, as well as many 
 other systems that use Linux as the kernel. These 
 libraries provide critical APIs including ISO C11, 
 POSIX.1-2008, BSD, OS-specific APIs and more. These APIs 
 include such foundational facilities as open, read, write,
 malloc, printf, getaddrinfo, dlopen, pthread_create, crypt,
 login, exit and more.

 The GNU C Library is designed to be a backwards compatible,
 portable, and high performance ISO C library. It aims to 
 follow all relevant standards including ISO C11, 
 POSIX.1-2008, and IEEE 754-2008. 

 This scripts will be intended to be the dependency of
 applications from newer systems (for example from Debian
 Unstable), so you can try to run them on older GNU/Linux
 distributions (for example the previous Ubuntu LTS 
 versions).
